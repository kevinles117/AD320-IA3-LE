For my 5 events, I used click, mouseover, mouseout, keydown and mousedown events.

Click changes the text when you click on it.
Mouseover changes the text when you wave your mouse over it.
Mouseout changes the text when you have your mouse on it and move it away.
Keydown pops an alert when you press any key into the form.
Mousedown changes the text when you hold the mouse down.
